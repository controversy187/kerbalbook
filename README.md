# The Kerbal Science Handbook
A Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering the Solar System

- [Chapter 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](chapters/01_rocket_equation.md)

## What is this?
This is a guide to orbital mechanics, spaceflight, and astrophysics. It is also a practical walkthrough for *Kerbal Space Program*. The two go hand in hand. The main goal is to understand how our own planet, Earth, works. How does gravity consistently thwart our efforts to float around in the air? Why don't the planets in our Solar System ever collide with each other? Why don't things fall "up" in Australia (or Canada, for our Aussie-normal friends)? The goal of this guide is to help us all (myself included) understand how our solar system works. The way we'll be learning this, together, is by slowly working through the game Kerbal Space Program. This will sort of be our "lab" for the lessons that we'll be learning. Fortunately for us, this game has something of a structure to it, which allows us to build on our lessons as we go.

## Who am I?
I'm Brett, from Earth. I'm not anyone special, and I don't have any formal education or training in any space-related field. I'm a software engineer, data analyst, and machine learning enthusiast. I have that overwhelming sense of awe and wonder that so many of us do when we look up at the night sky and see stars, the moon, planets, comets, meteors, and all the wonderful things that exist outside the boundary of our atmosphere. I'm also amazed by things _inside_ our atmosphere, but for some reason space really captivates me. I want to learn more about it, and I've had some fun playing Kerbal Space Program, so I thought I'd try structuring my learning and education by learning the concepts as I play the entire KSP game. Ambitious? Maybe. I know so little that I don't know how ambitious this really is. But I'm inviting you along for the ride!

## What will you need?
As of right now, writing this as of December, 2025, I think you'll just need a copy of Kerbal Space Program. I'm playing this on PC, but I'm not using mods, and I'm not planning on using the expansion packs. KSP is available on other platforms, but the game is largely the same. If you're on another platform, you might need to translate some controls, as I'm a keyboard/mouse player. Also, we'll be using "Science" mode for KSP, not "Career" mode. We're trying to understand systems of heavenly bodies, interplanetary travel, aerodynamics, and orbital mechanics. Contracts are too complicated, and budgets aren't any fun. So we'll explore the Science mode, which will help guide our progression and self-pace our education.

## Wait, what is Kerbal Space Program?
If you're here to just to learn the space stuff, great! If Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is completely new to you, here it is in 10 seconds. KSP is sort of a video game, and sort of a simulator. It's a virtual "Solar" system, with analogs for several of our Solar System's planets. Instead of Earth, the game starts on Kerbin. Kerbin has a moon, named The Mun, and a sun, named Kerbol. There are several other planets of various sizes and densities. The "point" of KSP is to design and build vehicles to explore this system, visiting the planets and moons. But that's a very loose goal. In reality, KSP is sandbox game, where you have more or less total freedom over what you do and how you do it. This guide will aim to do ALL THE THINGS! in the game, increasing in challenge and difficulty.

As we progress, our astronauts (Kerbals), will do science. When they do science, they collect science and need to get that science back to Kerbin. Once the science is back at Kerbin, it can be used to unlock new technologies, extending our reach into the cosmos, and opening up new opportunities to do more Science!
